# Palindrome-checker

This app is checking if the input word is a palindrome

## How to run

Simply, open index.html file on your browser

## Project Description

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards, such as the words madam or racecar, the date and time 12/21/33 12:21, and the sentence: "A man, a plan, a canal â€“ Panama".

The main challenge for me was working with input values and reversing the strings.
